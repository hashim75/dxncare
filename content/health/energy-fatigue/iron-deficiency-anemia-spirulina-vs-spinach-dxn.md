short_description: "Eating spinach but still anemic? Discover the bioavailability crisis and how DXN Spirulina offers a superior, gut-friendly solution."
hero_section_paragraph: "In Pakistan, anemia is a silent epidemic. But 'eating your greens' might be failing you. Spinach contains oxalates that block iron absorption. This report reveals the Functional Medicine approach to fixing anemia using the superior bioavailability of Spirulina and the gut-healing power of Ganoderma."

quick_snapshot: "<ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong>The Spinach Myth:</strong> Spinach is rich in oxalates, which bind to iron and prevent absorption. You absorb less than 5% of the iron in spinach.</li><li id=\"\"><strong>Spirulina Superiority:</strong> Spirulina has no cellulose wall, making its iron highly bioavailable. It also contains Phycocyanin, which stimulates bone marrow to produce red blood cells (erythropoiesis).</li><li id=\"\"><strong>The Tea Blockade:</strong> Drinking chai with meals reduces iron absorption by 60% due to tannins. This is a primary cause of anemia in Pakistan.</li><li id=\"\"><strong>Gut Inflammation:</strong> If your gut is inflamed, your body releases Hepcidin, which blocks iron absorption. Ganoderma (Reishi) lowers inflammation to 'unlock' the iron gates.</li><li id=\"\"><strong>The Energy Engine:</strong> Anemia isn't just about blood; it's about mitochondria. Cordyceps helps your cells generate ATP even when oxygen is low, fighting fatigue.</li></ul>"
introduction_of_blog: "You feel like a 'walking zombie,' but your doctor says 'eat more spinach.' Why isn't it working? This guide explores the biochemistry of bioavailability, the impact of phytates in Roti, and the Spirulina-Cordyceps protocol to rebuild your blood."

benefit___1_title: "High Bioavailability"
benefit___1_detail: "Unlike spinach (locked by oxalates), Spirulina has a soft mucopolysaccharide cell wall, allowing for rapid and high-efficiency iron absorption."
benefit___2_title: "Erythropoiesis"
benefit___2_detail: "Phycocyanin in Spirulina mimics the action of Erythropoietin (EPO), stimulating stem cells in the bone marrow to differentiate into red blood cells."
benefit___3_title: "Hepcidin Regulation"
benefit___3_detail: "Ganoderma reduces systemic inflammation, which lowers Hepcidin—the hormone that blocks iron absorption during chronic illness."
benefit___4_title: "Complete Protein"
benefit___4_detail: "Hemoglobin requires globin (protein) + heme (iron). Spirulina provides the complete amino acid profile needed to synthesize the protein structure of blood."
benefit___5_title: "Mitochondrial Efficiency"
benefit___5_detail: "Cordyceps improves the efficiency of the Electron Transport Chain, allowing the body to produce more ATP even when oxygen transport is compromised by anemia."
how_to_use: "<ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">The Golden Rule:</strong> Separate Tea/Coffee from Spirulina by 2 hours. Tannins block iron.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">The Booster:</strong> Always take Spirulina with Vitamin C (Lemon/Orange) to boost absorption by 300%.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">The Gut Prep:</strong> Take RG/GL at night to reduce gut inflammation so you can absorb nutrients the next day.</li></ul>"

faq_question___1: "Is spinach bad for me?"
faq_answer___1: "No, but it is not a good source of iron. Eat it for fiber and folate, but do not rely on it to fix anemia. Cook it to reduce oxalates."
faq_question___2: "Can Spirulina cause constipation?"
faq_answer___2: "Rarely. Unlike synthetic iron pills (ferrous sulfate) which cause severe constipation, Spirulina is a whole food and is generally gentle on the gut."
faq_question___3: "Why no tea with meals?"
faq_answer___3: "Tea contains tannins. These bind to iron in your stomach, forming an insoluble complex that you poop out. Wait 1 hour after eating to drink tea."
faq_question___4: "How long to fix anemia?"
faq_answer___4: "Red blood cells live for 120 days. You need consistent supplementation for 3-4 months to see a full turnover and restoration of ferritin levels."
faq_question___5: "Can I take this if pregnant?"
faq_answer___5: "Spirulina is often recommended for pregnancy due to its iron and protein content. However, always consult your OBGYN before starting any new supplement."

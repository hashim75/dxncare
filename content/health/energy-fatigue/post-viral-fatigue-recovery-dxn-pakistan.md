hero_section_paragraph: "Recovering from the flu or COVID often leaves a lingering shadow: Post-Viral Fatigue. This isn't just 'tiredness'; it's a cellular energy crisis. This report explains the mitochondrial hijacking caused by viruses and offers a recovery roadmap using DXN Cordyceps, Ganoderma, and Spirulina to reboot your biological batteries."

benefit___1_title: "ATP Restoration"
benefit___1_detail: "Cordyceps contains adenosine, which directly replenishes the ATP energy pools depleted by viral replication, helping to lift the 'heavy' feeling of fatigue."
benefit___2_title: "Immune Modulation"
benefit___2_detail: "Ganoderma (Reishi) acts as a biological thermostat, calming an overactive immune system (inflammation) or boosting a weak one, preventing autoimmune flare-ups."
benefit___3_title: "Mitochondrial Protection"
benefit___3_detail: "Spirulina's Phycocyanin is a potent antioxidant that protects mitochondria from the 'oxidative burst' caused by fighting off infections."
benefit___4_title: "Oxygen Utilization"
benefit___4_detail: "Cordyceps improves VO2 Max and bronchial function, aiding recovery for those suffering from residual shortness of breath after respiratory flu."
benefit___5_title: "Gut Repair"
benefit___5_detail: "Viruses often damage the gut lining. The prebiotic polysaccharides in Ganoderma and Spirulina help restore the microbiome, which is crucial for immunity."

faq_question___1: "Can I exercise to get energy back?"
faq_answer___1: "No! In post-viral fatigue, exercise can be dangerous. It causes 'Post-Exertional Malaise' (PEM). Rest now to recover faster. Start gentle walking only when you feel 80% better."
faq_question___2: "How does Cordyceps help?"
faq_answer___2: "It acts as a 'lung tonic' and increases cellular energy (ATP). It helps you breathe easier and clears the metabolic waste (lactate) that causes muscle pain."
faq_question___3: "Why am I depressed after the flu?"
faq_answer___3: "Neuroinflammation. The immune system inflames the brain to make you rest (sickness behavior). Ganoderma helps lower this inflammation, lifting the mood."
faq_question___4: "Is coffee bad for recovery?"
faq_answer___4: "Regular coffee can be too harsh on recovering adrenals. DXN Lingzhi Coffee is buffered with Reishi, making it a safer, gentler option if you need a lift."
faq_question___5: "How long will this last?"
faq_answer___5: "It varies. With proper rest and nutrition (Spirulina/Cordyceps), most people recover in 2-4 weeks. pushing through can extend it to months."

short_description: "A practical, easy-to-follow guide that explains the different types of arthritis (osteoarthritis vs rheumatoid), common pain patterns, an anti-inflammatory food-and-movement plan, and safe, evidence-aware supplement guidance (including how to evaluate Spirulina and DXN products)."
hero_section_paragraph: "Arthritis isn’t one single condition — it’s a set of joint problems with different causes and treatments. Whether you’re stiff in the morning or your knees ache after a walk, this guide helps you spot the difference between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, try food and movement strategies that ease symptoms, and make smart choices about supplements. Practical, no-nonsense, and focused on what you can do today."

quick_snapshot: "<ul id=\"\"><li><strong id=\"\">Two common types:</strong> Osteoarthritis (wear-and-tear) causes joint pain tied to use and age; Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammatory, often symmetric, joint pain and requires specialist care.</li><li><strong id=\"\">Pain patterns differ:</strong> OA often causes pain that worsens with activity and eases with rest; RA causes morning stiffness lasting an hour or more and joint swelling that may improve with activity.</li><li><strong id=\"\">Lifestyle helps:</strong> An anti-inflammatory plate, regular low-impact movement, weight management and strength training reduce symptoms and slow functional decline.</li><li><strong id=\"\">Supplements vary:</strong> Omega-3s and turmeric have the strongest, consistent supportive evidence for inflammatory joint conditions.

introduction_of_blog: "Joint pain is one of the most common reasons people visit a doctor. But “arthritis” is an umbrella term — and the right action depends on which form you have. Treating osteoarthritis focuses on protecting joints, improving mechanics and relieving pain; treating rheumatoid arthritis focuses on controlling the immune process to prevent joint damage. The good news is many daily choices help with both: the right foods, a safe exercise plan, better sleep and, in some cases, targeted supplements. This article gives practical steps you can use immediately and a careful look at supplements — including how to choose DXN products safely."

how_to_use_image: ""
faq_question___1: "How can I tell OA from RA at home?"
faq_answer___1: "OA tends to be activity-related pain that improves with rest and causes localized joint stiffness that is usually brief. RA commonly causes morning stiffness lasting an hour or more, symmetric joint swelling, and fatigue; RA needs urgent medical assessment."
faq_question___2: "Are supplements safe with arthritis medications?"
faq_answer___2: "Some are, some interact. Omega-3s, turmeric, glucosamine each have interaction profiles. Always check with your prescribing clinician before adding any supplement."
faq_question___3: "Does Spirulina help joint pain?"
faq_answer___3: "Spirulina is rich in antioxidants and nutrients that can support general inflammation control and nutrition. Evidence for direct, significant pain relief is preliminary — think of Spirulina as nutritional support rather than a primary treatment."
faq_question___4: "How much exercise is safe for sore joints?"
faq_answer___4: "Start with low-impact activities (walking, swimming), 20–30 minutes most days, and add two light strength sessions weekly. Adjust intensity to pain: some increase in discomfort is normal at first, but prolonged sharp pain is a sign to back off and consult a therapist."
faq_question___5: "When should I see a rheumatologist?"
faq_answer___5: "See a rheumatologist if you have persistent joint swelling, prolonged morning stiffness, rapid symptom progression, or lab/imaging tests suggest inflammatory arthritis."
